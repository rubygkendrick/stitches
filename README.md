## KitForm.jsx

`KitForm.jsx` serves as the primary component for both creating a new kit and editing an existing one. It facilitates user interaction with input fields and relies heavily on the state management of `currentKit` and `currentKitStitchIds`.

### Usage Notes:

- **Editing an Existing Kit**: Editing an existing kit involves pre-populating the form fields with the existing data. Ensure that the `currentKit` and `currentKitStitchIds` states are appropriately updated with the existing kit details upon rendering the form.

### Important Considerations:

- **State Management**: Be cautious when manipulating the `currentKit` and `currentKitStitchIds` states. Any changes made to these states will reflect immediately in the form fields.

- **Validation**: Implement necessary validation checks to ensure that the data entered in the form is accurate and meets the required criteria.

- **Event Handling**: Handle user interactions and form submissions carefully to maintain the integrity of the `currentKit` and `currentKitStitchIds` states.

Please review and test thoroughly before making any modifications to `KitForm.jsx`. In case of any uncertainties or issues, refer to the state management logic and ensure consistency in data handling.
